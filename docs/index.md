# Courtgrabber Documentation

Welcome to the documentation site for the Courtgrabber service. If you've never used Courtgrabber, read on to find out why you should give it a try.

## What is Courtgrabber?

Courtgrabber offers a hassle-free way for tennis club members to reserve a court when they want one. With the Courtgrabber service, you can submit court reservations ahead of the reservation window your clubâ€™s reservation software assigns.

## Why use Courtgrabber?

Convenience, plain and simple.

Let's say you want to play tennis Tuesday at 8:00 AM, and your club has specified a 72-hour reservation window. You would need to be online at 8:00 AM on the previous Saturday to ensure you get a court. If you would rather sleep in on Saturday, submit your reservation request to Courtgrabber more than three days in advance, and the service will connect to your club's software at exactly the 72-hour mark to make your reservation.

## How do I get Courtgrabber to work on my machine?

You can submit reservation requests using the Courtgrabber service via its command-line interface (CLI). Use the [Getting Started page](getting_started) to find out how to download and install the CLI. The [user guide](user_guide) includes instructions for performing common tasks with the CLI. Please note that the Courtgrabber CLI is currently supported only on MacOS.

## How do I build on the Courtgrabber project?

Courtgrabber has a REST API that communicates with tennis club software. The [developer guide](api_reference) contains the information you will need to integrate Courtgrabber with your own project.
