# Welcome 

Welcome to the Courtgrabber Documentation public repository. These files have been formatted according to the MkDocs theme and are best viewed on an MkDocs site. We have not yet found a permanent hosting service, but we hope to make the move soon. In the meantime, you can view the files by downloading MkDocs, cloning this repo, and running the built-in MkDocs dev server to view the site locally.

# Installing MkDocs

Run the following command from your command line to install MkDocs.

`pip install mkdocs`

If you encounter any issues, refer to the [MkDocs Installation Guide](https://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/installation/) for more detailed instructions.

# Creating your Courtgrabber project

[Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) and [clone](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) this repo to your local machine. Your project directory should contain the `mkdocs.yml` configuration file and a `docs` directory with four Markdown files and an `images` subdirectory.

# Viewing the Courtgrabber MkDocs site

From your command line, navigate to your new project directory and then run the following command:

`mkdocs serve`

With the server running, open `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` in your browser to view Courtgrabber's documentation.
