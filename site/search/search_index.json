If you've never used Courtgrabber, read on to find out why you should give it a try. What is Courtgrabber? Courtgrabber offers a hassle-free way for tennis club members to reserve a court when they want one. With the Courtgrabber service, you can submit court reservations ahead of the reservation window your club\u2019s reservation software assigns. Why use Courtgrabber? Convenience, plain and simple. Let's say you want to play tennis Tuesday at 8:00 AM, and your club has specified a 72-hour reservation window. You would need to be online at 8:00 AM on the previous Saturday to ensure you get a court. If you would rather sleep in on Saturday, submit your reservation request to Courtgrabber more than three days in advance, and the service will connect to your club's software at exactly the 72-hour mark to make your reservation. How do I get Courtgrabber to work on my machine? You can submit reservation requests using the Courtgrabber service via its command-line interface (CLI). Use the Getting Started page to find out how to download and install the CLI. The user guide includes instructions for performing common tasks with the CLI. Please note that the Courtgrabber CLI is currently supported only on MacOS. How do I build on the Courtgrabber project? Courtgrabber has a REST API that communicates with tennis club software. The developer guide contains the information you will need to integrate Courtgrabber with your own project.","title":"About"},{"location":"#courtgrabber-documentation","text":"Welcome to the documentation site for the Courtgrabber service.

If you would like to use the Courtgrabber CLI, please refer to the user guide . The Courtgrabber API is an HTTP-based, RESTful service that interfaces with tennis club reservation software to make court reservations on behalf of club members. Most club software sets a reservation window. With Courtgrabber, users can submit a request outside that window, automating the reservation process. Courtgrabber's base URL is https://courtgrabber.herokuapp.com/api/ . The API has five endpoints, and it accepts JSON in request bodies and returns JSON in response bodies. Workflow A user's typical workflow might look like this: login to Courtgrabber, add a new reservation request, verify that the request was successful, and then logout. Here are the corresponding API calls for these tasks: POST /login POST /reservation-requests GET /reservation-requests POST /logout Users can also cancel pending requests. That API call is DELETE /api/reservation-requests/{id} . Authentication The first call to /login specifies the member's club email address and password as a JSON object in the body. A response of 200 OK includes a bearer token with a validity of 30 minutes. All other endpoints, including /logout , take the bearer token in the header ( Authorization: Bearer {token} ). Each use of the token, except with /logout , extends the token's validity for another 30 minutes. Reference documentation This section explains Courtgrabber's resources, endpoints, and status codes. Resources The Courtgrabber API has three resources: /api/login /api/logout /api/reservation-requests /api/login Use the Login API call to grant a club member access to Courtgrabber. /api/logout Use the Logout API call to terminate the current Courtgrabber session. /api/reservation-requests Reservation Requests is the core Courtgrabber resource. Use API calls against it to create new requests, view existing requests, or cancel requests. Logging into Courtgrabber Authenticates a user and grants them access for a Courtgrabber session.

Key terminology First, let's define a few key terms. Command-line interface (CLI) Also known as your computer's terminal , the command-line interface is a tool for communicating with your computer via text. Instead of navigating with a mouse or selecting a program based on its icon, you can interact with your machine using only keyboard commands. Command prompt The command prompt is the text at the beginning of each command line in a CLI. On a Mac, it usually looks something like user ~ $ . The prompt tells you which directory, or folder, you are currently working in. Reservation request A reservation request is a pending message to the tennis club's reservation software that includes the date, start time, duration, court number, host player's name, ball machine necessity, and if required, the second player's name. Upon creation, Courtgrabber assigns each reservation request a unique ID. The request remains pending until Courtgrabber secures the reservation. Once the reservation time elapses, the request is automatically deleted. Desired date The desired date is the day you want to play tennis. Courtgrabber accepts dates as YYYY-MM-DD, such as 2022-12-09. Desired start time The desired start time is when you want to start playing. Courtgrabber lets you list multiple start times in order of preference, in case your first choice is unavailable. The format is HHMM in 24 hour time with each choice separated by a comma (e.g. 1300,1330,1400). Duration Duration is the length of time you want to play. The options are 30, 60, or 90 minutes. Court numbers The court number corresponds to the tennis club's number. You can choose which court you want to reserve by entering a list of numbers, comma-separated in order of preference (e.g. 4,5,6). Host player The host player is the person responsible for the reservation. Reserve ball machine You can reserve a ball machine along with your court. Add a second player If you are not reserving a ball machine, you must add a second player. Installation Now that you know the key terminology, it's time to install Courtgrabber and start requesting tennis courts. Opening the command-line interface You need to open your terminal to install and use Courtgrabber. On your Mac computer, press the command or \u2318 key and the space bar at the same time. In the search box that appears, start typing terminal and press Enter once the Terminal program appears. You now see a mostly empty box with a command prompt.
